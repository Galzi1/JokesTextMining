Predictive
Can we predict a juke score by its text?

Classification or Regression? -> Classification needs to transform by 3
if Reg (later stage if required -> cost / metric function RMSE MAE)

Come up with "most" features:
- number of words
- number of characters
- number of sentences
- number of punctuations
- number of all CAPS-LOCK words
- ratio of all CAPS-LOCK words to total words
- number of stopwords
- mean length of words
- number of syntax errors
- number of slang words
- number of new-lines
- specific punctuations: ?, !
- repetition of words
- 

[avoid both an absolute number *and* a ratio features of the same statistic]
[partition across different categories]

BoW, TF-IDF, ? (should be driven from what we learned at class)
